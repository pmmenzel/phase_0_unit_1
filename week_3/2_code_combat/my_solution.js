// Reflection:
// I really enjoyed this this lesson.  I think incorporating games in the learning process is one of the biggest missing pieces in education in general.  The beginner campaign wasn't extremely challenging but its still definitely gave you the solid surface level feel for javascript.  There were, however, a couple instances where I needed to looking up some syntax because I wasn't understanding how and why things were working in a certain way.  For example, understand what exactly 'this' meant and how different methods were passed onto it.  I thought that w3school.com and gitref.org/basic/ we're really helpful in providing me a explanation of some of the syntax I wasn't understanding.  Feeling fairly confident about the learning compentencies.  I hope there are more games in the future, cause I love it!
