// My role in the group is:  Person No. 1 - Translate tests into user stories. 

// Here is my part of the challenge:


// Test 1
// As a user I want to, know what test number this is and determine (assert) that sum is a function.  

// Test 2
// As a user I want to, know what test number this is and calculate the sum of a set of numbers with an odd length.

// Test 3
// As a user I want to, know what test number this is and calculate the sum of a set of numbers with an even length.

// Test 4
// As a user I want to, know what test number this is and determine (assert) that mean is a function.  

// Test 5
// As a user I want to, know what test number this is and calculate the average or mean of a set of numbers with an odd length.

// Test 6
// As a user I want to, know what test number this is and calculate the average or mean of a set of numbers with an even length.

// Test 7
// As a user I want to, know what test number this is and determine (assert) that median is a function.  

// Test 8
// As a user I want to, know what test number this is and calculate the median value of a set of numbers with an odd length.

// Test 9
// As a user I want to, know what test number this is and calculate the median value of a set of numbers with an even length.

// This was an interesting challenge and a very good learning experience.  First of all, I learned a lot about working with a group on a coding project where everyone has their own responsibilities.  I feel fortunate to have some accountability group members that generally work well together and have a solid understanding of the materials.  To be honest, I think that if I had a different roll in the project, I might have struggled more and help up the process.  Based on the user stories I gave, I wasn't sure that I provided enough information and, therefore, my group's coding would suffer.  In the end, it all worked out and I in fact did provide good user stories and enough information.  However, one of the group members had looked at the tests inadvertently but based on the final code we come up with I honestly don't think it matters.  My team did a great job and we were able to pass all the tests.   

// I'm definitely going to rereview all of our parts of this project as I really want to understand the mindset of translating information from each step of the process.  I really need to learn how to look at things different because I can't always see a clear path to the solution.  But I guess that's why we're learning.   Something that I specifically learned (from my group members), is to break down what information you do have already and what additional information you need to make sure you pass specific tests. 

// Overall, really great experience gained from this challenge.  And I have no doubt that we'll be doing a lot more of this.
