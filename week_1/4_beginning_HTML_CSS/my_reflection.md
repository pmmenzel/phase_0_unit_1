I think the organization of elements, the elements themselves and some of the general rules about tags makes a lot of practical sense.  What doesn't make sense, more or less at this point, is the creative ways in which you can use CSS to position things, move them, resize, isolate, etc.  Even though it sometimes doesn't make sense, its astonishing what you can do in HTML in conjunction with CSS.  Which is what makes this so interesting because you can know all the code/commands in HTML/CSS but you have to be able to think creatively in order to make beautiful functioning websites.  
This was a good lesson as it solidfied a few concepts that I wasn't quite getting from our prerequisite work, namely, the difference between class and IDs and when to use them.  That was very helpful information to solidfy.  Also, I found some great side links to some quick reference pages such as standard colors, fonts, etc.
