* What 2 new things did you learn about the web?
	(1) I learned that the internet and the world wide web are not the same thing.  Mainly, that the internet is interconnected computers/servers around world and the web is all the webpages we see using our web browsers. 
	(2) I learned that what ultimately makes a well-architected website is:  (a) deepen engagement, (b) increase conversion, (c) raise satisfaction, and (d) bring users back.
* What are some important things to remember when setting up your HTML site?
	Important things to remember when setting up your HTML site would be (1) what you want your domain name, (2) where you want to have your website hosted and (3) the associated costs.  Its also important to know whether your going to have a website which will mostly be static or a web app which will involve using input/interactions, databases, etc. 
* How did you feel when you saw your web page live?
	I felt excited that it worked.  Also relieved.  Its a small step the right direction but anything I actually do right is a victory!
* Did you have an "aha" moments or were any concepts solidified?
	I don't know if anything was concretely solidfied but I'm definitely feeling more and more comfortable about working with git as well as using my terminal to do so.  I've taken it upon myself to doing mostly everything through my terminal rather than my github app so I can deepen my understanding of it as much as possible.  I woudld recommend the same for anyone else.

* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.
	I didn't necessiarly find any other resources that assisted me but I did search through the websites and articles referenced in the lesson to see what other information was available.  As you may or may not be aware, many informational websites have mostly the same information but I realized that some explain things better than others, in my opinion anyway.
