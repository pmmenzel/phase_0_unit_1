I had many questions about positioning, really not fully grasping the inner workings of this particular function.  As I researched certain questions about this, w3schools.com provided a lot of great resources that I can use as a guide.  I'm still working on fully understanding it but this is a good crutch for now. 

I feel like I learn something new every time I do an excercise or challenge or even just re-learn something from the prerequisite work.  This particular lesson I learned/re-learned all about those psuedo selectors.  In some of the lessons before this one I totally forgot about those functions which would have been helpful.

Overall, I really liked this challenge as its very eye-opening as to where I need to improve on and put some added focus to.  Which is a lot.  I'm also starting to pick up on the process of setting up your shell for an html/css document.  This skill will only get better and will make working much more efficient.
