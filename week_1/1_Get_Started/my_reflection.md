## 1. [Git and Github](1_get_started/readme.md) Reflection

* What struggles did you have setting up git and GitHub? What did you learn in the process?
* Write an explanation of and compare git and GitHub to a non-technical audience. 
* Describe what version control is and how GitHub helps with it.
* Why do developers use version control (git)? Does that make sense to you? Why or why not?
* What doesn't make sense? What does?

Initially, I really wasn't understanding the difference and purpose of git and GitHub.  However, after reviewing some of the references and going through some of the mini challenges it really started to make sense.  I understand now that Git is for your local repo (i.e. on your computer) and Github is your remote repo (i.e. on the internet).  It was also very useful to learn some of the various commands that one would use to create repositories, branches, staging files, pushing files to Github, etc.   Also, really understanding the relationship between git and Github allowed me to see why this is such a powerful tool.   Ultimately, git and GitHub are tools for version control.  Git and Github allow you individually, or in a group of collaborators, to work on a coding project, paper, report, etc., at the same time.   Git keeps a record, or timeline, of all the changes you or any of your collaboraters have made all while not overriding eachothers work.   It also allows you to merge all changes made as you progress.  

Based on what I read, git is a widely used tool in the dev community and for good reason, in my opinion.   If a group of devs are working on a large project with many different components, git and GitHub allows them to take portions of the "master" project file and work on them individually.  Each one of the devs can make changes, additions and many other tasks related to the project all the while not having to worry about losing past work, over writing others work, etc.  This makes a lot of sense to me because collaboration can become very difficult when the primary working document traditionally could only be edited by one person.   Git completely eleviates this obstacle allowing for a much more efficient work flow. 

Lastly, even though I have a much greater understanding of git and GitHub, there are aspects that I still need to grasp more completely.  This would include how and when branching works, making sure you are checking out the right version of a document and updating new versions.  But continuing to use git and reviewing additional resources about it, I think I'll be able to better grasp some of these concepts
