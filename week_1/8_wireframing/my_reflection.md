This lesson about design as very interesting.  The process of Design thinking makes a lot of sense to me.  Before, I thought programmers would just start coding away and adjust the layout or design as you go or later.  But this Design Thinking approach is something I haven't heard of before and there are a lot of great applications for it, not just in coding.  The concept and work flow is very new to me but I think that its something I will definitely like to delve into more.  I think the design and user experience of a website is a very interesting part of the programming process.  I enjoyed the idea of putting together the wire frame pages as its very helpful when you actually start putting in code.  You basically have a target to shoot at but this also allows you to re-design when you run into logistical issues.  Its really great for testing ideas and fine-tuning already existing ones.  As I am brand new to this, I wonder what some of the best practices are in establishing these wireframes.  For example, I'm not sure how detailed or how general you should be in the early stages of wire framing.  Based on some of the readings and some additional resources it seems that there is no real right answer to this.  But as I work with them more, I think I'll start to get a better idea of what works best for me and/or my team.  Some of the wire frame tools found online are really awesome and very powerful.  I mostly used Balsamiq for my wire frames but I will definitely be playing around with the others mentioned in our materials as they seem to have their own benefits and uses.
