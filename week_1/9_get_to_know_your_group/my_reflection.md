Hey there Fellas!

My name is Patrick Menzel and I live in North Beach, San Francisco, CA. I've lived and grew up in the Bay Area, mostly the East Bay in San Leandro, for the majority of my life.  I went to school here to at NDNU in Belmont, just south of San Francisco about 30 mins.  I currently work as a Senior Paralegal which I've been doing for the past 7 years or so but had been looking for a change for quite sometime.  Hence why I'm now speaking with you fine people of DBC.  

I am generally available to do a peer-pairing session any time after 6 p.m. PST.  However, I usually get off between 5:30 and 6:00 p.m. so in all likelihood, I wouldn't be able to actually jump in a session until 6:30/7pm as I have a small commute.  Weekends will always be the best for me.

Take a moment to reflect on reading other people's responses regarding their fears about DBC. How did that make you feel? Did you feel better, worse, or something else all together? How has your experience this week influenced your feelings? All feelings are welcome and ok. Just take a moment to think about it and write it down. 

It appears that most people have very similar fears.  Just like Shereef stated in his kitchen v. table video, this are very typical feelings to have and they'd be worried if you didn't have them.  It's actually very comforting to read some the other cohorts fears and hesitations because it makes me realize that we're all just trying to figure it out.  I played basketball all the way through college and I've very accustomed to fear, nervousness and self-doubt.  I don't shy away from it but embrace it as much as I can.  I think sharing how we feeling going into this will allow us to have a strong sense of community.  This first week's work was a good wake up call for how I manage my time in general.  But more specifically, how much time actually goes into some of the assignments.  I need to realize that though DBC gives you a general idea of how long it will take each week, that can vary widely based on the individual, what's going on in their life, etc.  I'm submitted things late (obviously) but I know that I will be making some conscience adjustments in the coming weeks because I want to put my best efforts in.  Its really up to me.
