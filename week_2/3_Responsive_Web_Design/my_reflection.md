# U1.W2: Responsive Design Reflection

* What is responsive web design? Do you like it?  Do you think it's a good practice? Why or why not?
* How do you think smartphones and tablets have changed web design? How do you think new technology will change web design in the future?
* How do you think visually impaired people use the web? Can they? Should we design and development for them?
* What ideas and concepts have resonated with you when learning about the web and design? What seems stupid or doesn't make sense?
* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.

Responsive web design is adjusting your CSS file to allow for multiple devices and browsers the ability to view your content for varying screen sizes and units.  This is done by utilizing some fairly newer techniques such as media queries as well as utilizing ems and percentages instead of pixels.  This is an EXTREMELY useful technique due to the fact that in today's world we have so many different types of devices to view one website one from phones, computers, tablets, etc.  Not utilizing a responsive web design is like having a fixed mindset, you think that everything should be viewed the same way, no matter what the perspective.  As technology advances, we'll likely have more and more ways of viewing content so having a dynamic responsive website design is essential to the success of a website and a product.  

Interesting question regarding the visually impaired.  We definitely take our eye-sight for granted.  Responsive design, I think, could have a significant impact on the general involvement and interaction those with visual impairments will have. I can only assume that there must be a way through media queries that would allow that group of people the ability to better use the internet.  For example, if you could create a media query that would detect a particular setting on a phone or computer which would make the phone bigger, or automatically read the title of the page and/or its content.  

This lesson on web design has been very helpful in my generally understanding of the potential dynamics of a website.  I definitely had some "aha" moments as I previously didn't understand how you make items on a website fit or change on smaller or larger devices.
