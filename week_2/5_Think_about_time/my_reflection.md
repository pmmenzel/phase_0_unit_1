# U1.W2: Thinking About Time Reflection

* What is your biggest time management challenge with during Phase 0? 
* How will you combat that? 
* What techniques will you try?
* What is your overall plan for Phase 0?

So at my current job, time management, keeping track of deadlines, etc., are pretty much part of the job description.  So, initially, I wasn't too particularly concerned about my time management related to DBC phase 0.  I was sorely mistaken and arrogant for that decision.  I realized very quickly that I couldn't accurately anticipate things like how long a particular lesson, or unit week's work would take.  It was like I didn't know how to ride a bike but had to go to the store a mile away.  If I knew how to ride, it would take me 60 seconds to go that far but since I don't, its take significantly longer.  Generally, my biggest hurdle with managing my time is my job and the time commitments related to that.  I also have at least a 30 min commute each way for work.  This all adds to the fact that I need to strategizes more on my work.  For example, I will now do my best to front load my week and try to get through as much as the material as possible so that when the weekend rolls around, I can take more time to re-review things, and make sure I'm completely understanding all the competencies.  The last two weeks, for a variety of reasons, I've been rushed.  

#The plan
*create artificial deadlines
*create check-in reminders to make sure I'm on track
*confer with accountability group to determine how far behind/ahead I am
*Except for the GPS work, do a quick review of the lessons to see how we'll be going over and how much will be involved.
*towards the end of the week, check in with my AG or the DBC community to see how others are progressing and get some feedback on the week's work.
