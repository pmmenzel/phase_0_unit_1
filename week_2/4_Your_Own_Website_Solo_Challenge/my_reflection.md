My Website url: https://pmmenzel.github.io/

Discuss the following:
* What did you learn about design and user experience? 
* Do you like design and user experience? Was it fun working on your site, the plan, and/or the wireframe? (If you hated it, that's OK too)
* What was your process? What worked and didn't work?
* What would you like to add or change about the site next?
* Was it difficult to apply the material you learned? Did you find anything in your research you thought was super cool?
* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.

There was a lot to absorb during this week's lessons.  Web design is something that I really like and am interested in.  However, I'm still very new to this and it can be confusing at times deciding what the best way to treat a document.  But the good thing is that I learned great ways to plan out, build, code and test a site.  Conceptually, this is something I really appreciate.  I'm a planner and like to have compartmentalized steps during a project.  Having to go through an outline (wireframe) and utilizing that to build your html and css files I think is a brilliant idea.  It really helps me focus on one thing at a time, otherwise I get distracted and lose sight of what my objectives were.  This also ends up being very helpful to the user as you spend time thinking about what they need or want, then design around that.  This is fundamental in optimizing your product/website and providing the best possible user experience you can.  It also allows you to take in feedback during the initial stages or even after receiving feedback from users.  This all allows you to design and build a really beautiful and intuitive website.  So, overall, I very much enjoy this process, however, I don't know how good I would ultimately be at it.  But who really knows as I'm just starting out in this.  

As for my site specifically, I really need to get a better handle on how everything is positioned.  I even did my technical blog on positioning and I seem to still have trouble with it.  But, moving forward, I would like to add some link html files because as I currently have my website, there are only links to the units which contain my work (well not yet, but will).  Its a work in progress. 

Something REALLY cool that I learned during this lesson, was that I discovered what a color wheel is!  This is so freakin useful to come up with a color scheme for your website.  I really just thought people were amazing at matching colors and now I think that only a talented few can do it on their own...everyone else probably uses these (like I will!).
