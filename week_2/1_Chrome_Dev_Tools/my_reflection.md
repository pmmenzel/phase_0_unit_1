# U1.W2: Chrome Dev Tools Challenge Reflection

* Describe the Document Object Model? What about it makes sense to you? What doesn't? What seems good and bad about it?
* How did using Chrome Web Tools to look at your site and a wordpress.com site compare?
* Did you find Chrome Web Tools fun, helpful, or a pain to work with?
* Did you have an "aha" moments or were any concepts solidified?
* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.


A DOM is an application programming interface (API) which shows the structure of an HMTL document and how its accessed and manipulated. The structure is very logical and is presented very much like a tree.  I was having a hard time with this at first as I wasn't quite sure what it was or did (even after reading the material), so I kept going over some of the materials provided as well as additional resources.  Now (finally), I think that I at least understand it and it actually makes sense, generally.   I'm still not entirely sure where the DOM is typically located and when to utilize it.  At this point, it seems like a tool that chrome provided a plugin for on their browser but is this the most common place to find them?  I don't know.   Though DOM is an amazingly useful tool and has some even more amazing built in functions like the realtime editing, its an immensely dense interface with so many different functions and capabilities.  It makes my head spin a bit.   When I did the chrome web tools comparison of my site versus a wordpress.com site (I looked at postsecret.com) it was very interesting how involved all the various functions where in the postsecret site versus my own.   And even though I didn't understand everything, it was very easy to navigate through the chrome web tools.  The Chrome web tools overall was a very helpful and fun thing to play with but again, like I said before, it can make me dizzy with all the possible things you can do with it. What was great about this lesson was that I really didn't quite understand what Javascript was about.  But having to navigate through the web tools, watching the videos and playing with the code myself really made it clear what Java did.   It can access and manipulate any HTML elements, gather information from users via forms, etc.  Its the interactive side of a website. 

In conclusion, I think that I definitely got a grasp on what DOM and Javascript are, what they do and the basics of how they function.   And I'm really relieved about it because it was not making sense at first! (haha!)
