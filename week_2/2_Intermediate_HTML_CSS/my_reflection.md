# U1.W2: Intermediate HTML and CSS Reflection

* What do you think about web standards? Are they good or bad?
* Does the standard structure make sense to you? Why or why not?
* Do you like the new HTML5 elements, such as `<header>`, `footer`, and `nav`? Why or why not?
* Why is reset.css necessary? 
* What browsers have you used? Did you ever notice that sites looked different in different browsers? Do you think it's good or bad that they do?
* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.


I really like the idea of having standards because if gives you a really solid foundation to start with.  Even though there are some debates over using css resets, which resets, and which features you should have in your resets, its ultimately still a good place to jump off from.  Also, knowing some standard widths and sizes helps expedite the process of building your website where you can more quickly focus on the various tweaks and changes to make your sight unique and standout.  These standard practices make a lot of sense to me in terms of structure and even the terminology that's used for the tags.  The new HTML5 elements I think are a great addition and are very natural in their name/use.  It makes putting them in the proper place and referring to them in the CSS very logical.  But I also see how others prefer to just do divs and us classes/ids instead.  I'm still working on grasping some concepts and really getting my head wrapped around the idea of nesting, when things (such as the resets) can and are overwritten by your specific styles applied and the best procedure for me to follow to build my sit step by step.  I currently am trying to pay attention to so many things that I sometimes get lost and lose sight of what I first had in mind.  But at the very least, I know that reset are there to help you and allow your website's appearance to be consistent as possible across multiple browsers and devices.  I mostly use chrome and just looking at safari I didn't notice any significant differences in appearance.  Its unfortunate that browsers don't have some type of standard way to read all websites so these resets wouldn't be necessary but its good they have these resets nonetheless. 

I had some difficulty with make changes to the practice site "Women in Computers."  I'm not fully understanding when and how a reset is overridden and I spent some time trying to figure it out.  I hope that I can eventually understand this more as it will be very fundamental in the development of my overall skills.
